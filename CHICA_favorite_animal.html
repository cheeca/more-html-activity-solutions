    <p>The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal.<br> 
        It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae.<br>
        Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC.<br>
        It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact.<br>
        Valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin, the cat's retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats.<br>
